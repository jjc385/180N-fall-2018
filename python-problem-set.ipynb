    "### How to create a python module\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **module** is simply a python (.py) file that contains code, often useful functions, that can be imported and called into another python file or jupyter notebook.  To create and use a module simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a python (.py) file with the functions you'll want to import\n",
    "1. Import the module the way you would import numpy or scipy\n",
    "1. Call functions from the module\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I could create a module called `my_module.py` that contains a function called `fun` that takes floats as inputs.  Then, when I want to use the function from that module within another python file or jupyter notebook, I would execute the following code to import the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import my_module\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then I would execute the following to call the function and evaluate on the float `3.0`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_module.fun(3.0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Alternatively, I could alias the module if I want to work with a shorter name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import my_module as mm\n",
    "    mm.fun(3.0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "or I could import the function I want from the module so that I can avoid pre-pending the name of the module to the name of the function every time I want to call it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from my_module import fun\n",
    "    fun(3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that once a module is imported, the functions therein will be available from that point on, so you don't need to import the module more than once.  It's a good idea to import all modules you will be using at the top of the python file or notebook you're currently working in."

    "- Create a module whose filename is your codename (e.g. \"batman.py\").  You should have already chosen a codename in the survey I sent out in the beginning of class.  If you never filled out that survey, then let me know.\n",
    "- In this notebook, many of the problems ask you to write functions to accomplish certain taks.  Each of these functions should be written in the module you create whose filename is your codename.\n",
    "- Make sure the functions you write are put in the same sequence as the problems themselves for easy code review, and put a one-line comment preceding each function that serves to identify which functions are for which problems.\n",
    "- Include a docstring for each function.  You might consider reading [this stackexchange post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format) to familiarize yourself with various standard styles for docstrings.\n",
    "- Along with the module whose filename is your codename, you will be asked to turn in a Jupyter notebook in which the module you create is imported, and the functions it contains are tested and used in the way described in the problems.  Write enough detail in your notebook so that it convincingly demonstrates that you've done the problems correctly.  In most cases, this means doing some testing to show that your functions are working properly.  If desired, you can simply add your solutions to this notebook and turn that in."

The way the game works is that every time the die lands on side 1 or side 2, you win one dollar, and every time the die lands on side 3, 4, 5, or 6, your friend wins one dollar.  Because you really want to win the game at all costs, you decide to cheat and use a weighted die.  This means that the side is preferentially weighted so that sides 1 and 2 are each three times more likely to land face up than sides 3, 4, 5, and 6.  In other words, if $p_k$ denotes the probability that side $k$ will land face up, then\n",
